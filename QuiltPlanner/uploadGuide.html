    <h1>Half Square Triangles -- Image Preparation</h1>
    <p>
      To prepare images of your quilt blocks for upload, please crop the images
      into squares with the diagonal seam running from the upper left to the
      lower right.
      <br /><br />
      For the best results, make sure that the fabric seen in the lower left of
      each block image is consistent. (i.e. the darker side of each block)
      <br /><br />
      With those files ready to go, click the 'Choose Files' button, navigate to
      that folder, select the files you want to use, and click "Upload". *
      <br /><br />
      Have Fun!
      <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      *The files are not actually being uploaded / stored anywhere other than
      your browser, so please feel free to upload to your heart's content! Just
      know that you'll have to re-upload anytime you close the browser or
      refresh the page.
