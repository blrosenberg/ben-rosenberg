    <h1>Half Square Triangles -- Image Preparation</h1>
    <p>
      To prepare images of your quilt blocks for upload, please crop the images
      into squares with the diagonal seam running from the upper left to the
      lower right. If you are uploading more than 5 images (or if the page is
      running slowly in general) it may be helpful to upload smaller, resized
      copies of the images.
      <br /><br />
      For the best results, make sure that the fabric seen in the lower left of
      each block image is consistent. (i.e. the darker side of each block)
      <br /><br />
      With those files ready to go, click the 'Choose Files' button, navigate to
      that folder, select the files you want to use, and click "Upload". *
      <br /><br />
      Have Fun!
      <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      *The files are not actually being saved anywhere other than your browser,
      so please feel free to upload to your heart's content! Just know that
      you'll have to re-upload if you close the browser or refresh the page.
